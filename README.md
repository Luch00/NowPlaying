NowPlaying to text file using MsnMessenger interface

Able to get the artist - title information of currently playing song similarly to MSN / Windows Messenger
and write it to a text file.

Made this for osu! (enable messenger integration in options) but also works with players like Winamp and Foobar
if plugins that enable this functionality is installed.
